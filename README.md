# Advent Of Code 2020
https://adventofcode.com/2020/

To challenge myself I'll try to solve the problems using functional programming paradigm.
- [Referential transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency). So no mutables.
- Instead [method chaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining) can be used to eliminate the need for variables.
- Using [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) as a language

All the solutions can be run inside a web console of a browser.

## Daily focuses

1. Having quick working solution. Then refactoring it to functional.
2. Do clean coding to have more readable code. Naming variables, single reponsibility principle.
3. Use modulos to have purely mathematical solution (branchless programming).
4. Just lots of chaining.
5. Usage of consts. Describe section with brief comments.
